            <p id="introduction">The first thing we know about Livia Firth—though by no means the last—is that she’s married to Mr. 
            Darcy, or to every woman’s idea of the most charming, handsome Englishman on the planet, Colin Firth. 
            But Mrs. Firth (“Call me Livia, please”) is no Jane Austen heroine.</p>
            <p class="column">She’s a strikingly vivacious Italian who arrived for lunch at Gobo on the Upper 
            East Side of Manhattan looking eager and dazzling in black. Her informal eco-stylishness defines her. 
            Her jacket, she explained in her Anglo-Italian accent, was from a French brand, Kami Organic, 
            and was made with recycled leather and organic wool; her T-shirt was from the U.S. brand Stewart
            & Brown, specialists in organic cotton; her trousers, from the London shop Joseph, weren’t “eco”
            or “ethical,” however, but several years old and therefore “sustainable”; her shoes were of 
            handmade leather from a local family-run factory in Umbria—where her own family lives and she 
            family lives and she and her husband keep a house. Her watch was made of discarded wood, 
            but let’s not go into that now.</p>

                <p>Why would a liberated woman like Livia Firth, I wondered, take her husband’s surname? 
                “My maiden name is Giuggioli,” she said, “but it’s impossible for any English person 
                to say or write! Nobody can spell it. So you know what I decided? It’s just Firth. Five 
                letters. Very easy. But in Italy we are Colin and Livia Giuggioli! Because you try telling an 
                Italian how to say Firth! Fearth. You have to say Fearth!” The <br>Firths live in London, and they 
                have two children. She’s nine years younger than he, and they met in Cartagena, Colombia, where 
                he was filming the TV mini-series Nostromo and she was its production coordinator. “I was engaged 
                at the time, and we met on the set, which was in a church. We shook hands, and here we are today, 
                19 years later.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>“What happened to your poor old fiancé?”</p>
            <p>“The poor old fiancé is now married, with two girls. We’re still friends. His wife’s Australian. 
            But, you know, it’s funny. When I met Colin he wasn’t yet Mr. Darcy, and we started the courtship. 
            And then Pride and Prejudice came out, and the response from my family and all the Italians was 
            ‘Do you really consider this guy sexy?’ ”</p>

                    <p>She laughs easily (and it’s catching). “Italians can’t deal with English restraint. They think 
                        the reserve of an Englishman is constipated.”</p>
                        <p>“He won everyone over, though?”</p>
                        <p>“He did, because Colin isn’t like Mr. Darcy at all.”</p>

            <p>Gobo is a vegetarian restaurant, but Livia Firth isn’t a vegetarian. She likes the place for 
            its unbeatable avocado tartare with wasabi lime sauce, which she ordered with hand-wrapped 
            steamed vegetable dumplings. She made a neat link between food and her committed role as an 
            eco-fashion activist. “We’re trying nowadays to eat healthy, avoid pesticides, eat fresh and 
            green,” she said. “Why not care about the clothes we wear in the same way—where they were made, 
            and what they really cost in human and environmental terms?”</p>
            <p>Buzzwords such as “ethical fashion,” “eco,” and “green” are weighed down by the costly baggage 
            of sanctimony. (And fashion, after all, is meant to be fun.) But the impious Firth isn’t a stereotypical 
            eco-warrior. Sometimes described as “the Queen of the Green Carpet,” she’s the force behind green fashion 
            on the red carpet. Meryl Streep is but one of the A-listers (and Tom Ford one of the designers) who have 
            supported eco-friendly high fashion on the hallowed carpet during awards season—thereby helping turn 
            “Who are you wearing?” into “What are you wearing?”</p>
            <p>“At the Paris premiere of The King’s Speech, starring her husband as the King of 
            England, Livia appeared on his arm wearing a discarded moth-eaten suit of his recycled as a 
            patchwork dress. It’s all a deceptively un-serious way to convert powerful couturiers to the cause, 
            she explained, and raise the profile of sustainable fashion.</p>
